# Wit-R2-Client
A proof of concept for a virtual developer console assistant using Wit's machine learning/ai.

Inspired by Mark Zuckerberg's Jarvis Platform

# Getting Started
- Runs on NET 4.6.1
- Setup an account on Wit (You can use your GitHub account)
- Setup/Configure/Train your Wit app
  - For this proof of concept, I've only set up 3 intents:
    - Greeting - getting the app to recognise what phrases counts as a greeting eg. Hello, Hi...
    - Smalltalk - eg. How are you doing?
    - Getting the weather - eg. What's the weather like today? What's the weather like in Auckland today?
